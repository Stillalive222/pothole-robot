# Bitumen Buddy â€“ Semi-Autonomous Pothole Detection & Filling Robot

## Overview
Bitumen Buddy is a **semi-autonomous robot** developed as part of the **Design Practicum at IIT Mandi** for road maintenance automation.  
The robot detects potholes, estimates their volume, and dispenses filler material to repair them, while allowing RC override for operator control.  

## Features
- **4WD mobility platform** with Arduino-based motor control, GPS logging, and RC override  
- **Pothole detection** using YOLOv6 on Raspberry Pi  
- **Depth sensing & volume estimation** with Arducam ToF camera and Open3D processing  
- **Dual-servo dispensing system** for controlled material filling  
- Designed for **field deployability** with modular and robust chassis  

## Technical Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Arducam ToF Camera, Dual Servo Mechanism  
- **Software:** Python, Open3D, YOLOv6, GPS logging  
- **Design Tools:** CAD modeling (Isometric & Front views), Embedded C for motor control
